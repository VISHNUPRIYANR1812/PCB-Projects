🚀 Introducing the Isolated SPI-CAN Node PCB – Designed in Just 3 Hours! 🚀

Today, I designed a single-layer PCB called "Isolated SPI-CAN Node" in just 3 hours! This board integrates the MCP2515 standalone SPI-CAN controller and TJA1050 physical CAN transceiver, ensuring isolation between the host controllers (like Arduino, ESP32) and the CAN bus.

🔹 Key Features:

✅ DIP Switch for SPI Isolation – Easily disconnect SPI lines while programming the main MCU.

✅ Power Isolation Switch – Turn off power to the node when needed.

✅ Power Status LEDs – Clear visual indicators for power status.

✅ 120Ω CAN Termination – Provided as solder pads for easy implementation.

✅ Flexible Connectivity – Screw terminals and jumper headers for CAN_H, CAN_L, and C_GND.

🔍 Use Case:

Designed for industrial automation, automotive networks, and IoT applications, this PCB ensures robust and error-free CAN communication. By isolating the CAN bus from the host controller, it protects Arduino, ESP32, and other MCUs from electrical noise and voltage fluctuations.

💡 Excited to share this fast and efficient PCB design process! Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback.
