#  SPI-CAN Node V1 to CANode V2: A SMARTER, WIRELESS UPGRADE! 

The V2 design introduces critical improvements to support wireless diagnostics, cloud integration, and real-time monitoring, making it a game-changer for CAN-based applications in automotive, industrial automation, and IoT systems.

## 🔍 V1 Limitations:


- MCP2515 CAN Controller with TJA1050 Transceiver provided standard SPI-CAN conversion but lacked wireless capabilities.
- DIP switch-based 120Ω termination was manually adjustable but not adaptive.
- Limited debugging support due to single-layer PCB.
